    <p>Hi! This is a test of a playable prototype for Cordon Sanitaire, a game about Quarantine.Playable prototypes are
        just testing game mechanics — there’s no art, story, fancy interface.</p>

    <p>In this test we are getting 20 or so people into a game with a collective goal: at the end of 45 seconds, isolate
        Patient Zero (RED CIRCLE) in a quarantine line.</p>

    <p>You are the BRIGHT GREEN CIRCLE. Other players are DARK GREEN CIRCLES.</p>

    <p>Together, you and the other players will try to draw a continuous line around Patient Zero. But at any time, you
        can only draw a line between yourself and one other player. The success of failure of the group will depend
        entirely on how you can coordinate your actions … without being able to communicate. You can change who you
        connect to at any time.</p>

    <p>Patient Zero will move randomly, as Patient Zeroes do. You may have to adapt. And don’t trap anyone else in the
        quarantine with them. Game will last 45 seconds. Good luck to all of us...</p>
